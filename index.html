        <p>
        Musk was <b>born</b> and grew up in <i>Pretoria, South Africa</i>. He attended the
        Univeprersity of Pretoria before moving to Canada at age 17, acquiring
        citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he
        matriculated at Queen's University and transferred to the University of
        Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University
        but decided to instead pursue a business career, co-founding the web
        software company Zip2 with his brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired
        by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded the
        online bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal.
        eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Musk founded
        SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company,
        and is its CEO and chief engineer. In 2004, he was an early investor in
        the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (now Tesla, Inc.).
        He became its chairman and product architect, eventually assuming the
        position of CEO in 2008. In 2006, he helped create SolarCity, a solar
        energy company that was later acquired by Tesla and became Tesla Energy.<br>
        In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence
        research company. The following year, he co-founded Neuralink—a
        neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces—and The
        Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2022, Musk purchased
        the social media platform Twitter for <Strong>$44 billion</Strong>. He has proposed a
        hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system and is the president
        of the philanthropic <em>Musk Foundation</em>.

        Musk has made controversial statements regarding politics and technology, particularly on Twitter, and is a highly polarizing figure. 
        He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, such as spreading COVID-19 misinformation. 
        In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for falsely tweeting that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. 
        Musk stepped down as chairman of Tesla and paid a <strong>$20 million</strong> fine as part of a settlement agreement with the SEC. 
        Following his failed submarine proposal during the Tham Luang cave rescue, Musk <em>won</em> a defamation case brought against him by a British caver involved in the operation.
